# text-to-podcast-llm-app

This Shiny for Python app is inspired by a recent feature into notebooklm form Google. It summarizes your text and turns it into a short podcast audio clip. The app is a simple interface that allows users to input text and generate an audio file from the text. The app is built using the `gtts`  and `OpenAI` libraries.

## Setup

The app expects that you have an OpenAI API key that you can paste into the input box. You can get one by visting the OpenAI API [quickstart page](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/).

## Accessing the app

You can clone this repo and run the app locally or access the app via [Connect Cloud](https://connect.posit.cloud/) at the website link in the repository details (under "About"). You may need to create a Connect Cloud account to access the app.
